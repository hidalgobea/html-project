<h1>Build a Support Network</h1>
<img src="build.PNG" alt="" srcset="">
<p>Surrounding yourself with people who care about you can help support your mental health. Here are some ways to build a support network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Join a support group: Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and connection with others who understand what you are going through.</li>
  <li>Talk to friends and family: Talking to friends and family can provide emotional support and help you feel less isolated.</li>
  <li>Consider therapy: A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to talk about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences.</li>
  <li>Volunteer: Volunteering can provide a sense of purpose and connection with others.</li>
  <li>Join a club or organization: Joining a club or organization can provide a sense of community and connection with others who share similar interests.</li>
</ul>
