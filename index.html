      <li>Eat a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can help support mental health.</li>
      <li>Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for mental health. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.</li>
      <li>Practice relaxation techniques: Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
